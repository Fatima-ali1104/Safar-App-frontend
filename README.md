## 📝 Safar App
**Travel Booking App**  
A MERN stack application that allows users to explore trips, book their next adventure, and manage their bookings through a secure dashboard. The app was built to simplify the travel planning process, offering a user-friendly interface with authentication and authorization features.  

We built this project to practice full-stack development, focusing on authentication flows, CRUD operations, and responsive UI design.
